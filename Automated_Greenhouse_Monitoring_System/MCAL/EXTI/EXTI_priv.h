Bit 6 – ISC2: Interrupt Sense Control 2
The Asynchronous External Interrupt 2 is activated by the external pin INT2 if the SREG I-bit and
the corresponding interrupt mask in GICR are set.
If ISC2 is written to zero, a falling edge onINT2 activates the interrupt.
If ISC2 is written to one, a rising edge on INT2 activates the interrupt.

Bit 6 – INTF0: External Interrupt Flag 0
When an edge or logic change on the INT0 pin triggers an interrupt request, INTF0 becomes set

The flag is cleared when the interrupt routine is executed.
Alternatively, the flag can be cleared by writing a logical one to it. This flag is always cleared
when INT0 is configured as a level interrupt
